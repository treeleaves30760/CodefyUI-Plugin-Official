/**
 * CodefyUI plugin SDK — types + React bindings.
 *
 * This `sdk/` folder is vendored into the plugin template (clone-and-own). It
 * mirrors the host's plugin API; keep it in sync with the CodefyUI release you
 * target. Import everything from here:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { defineTool, useGraph, type CodefyUIPluginAPI } from './sdk';
 * ```

export * from './types';
export * from './react';
